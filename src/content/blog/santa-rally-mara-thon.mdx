With only one trading day left before Christmas, it appears that Santa may have come early this year! At the time of writing [Marathon Digital (MARA)](https://www.mara.com/) is flirting with the **$27.00** price point and up over **52%** this week alone!

For those who are unfamiliar [Marathon Digital](https://www.mara.com/) is a bitcoin mining company with a focus on blockchain technologies and various digital assets. While crypto has definitely fallen out of favor in recent memory, it appears that things might be changing...

> Before market open, Marathon shook up the crypto miner scene by announcing that it had agreed to acquire a pair of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) mining sites. It bought the pair from subsidiaries of finance company Generate Capital at a price of $178.6 million. This purchase price is to be paid entirely in cash.

I’ve been following this stock along with her little brother [Riot Platforms (RIOT)](https://www.riotplatforms.com/) since the height of the pandemic, and after what can only be described as a boring year for trading all around, I’m finally starting to feel excited again!

Rumors have also been circulating for quite some time about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving [spot bitcoin ETFs](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/the-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-could-quickly-reach-your-401k-plan.html) in early January 2024. This prospect along with the halving scheduled later next year has sent Bitcoins price skyrocketing 64.33% over the past 3 months with Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms following in hot pursuit.

Along with this the Fed has taken a less hawkish stance as inflation has retreated faster than anticipated, with more rumors quickly circulating that interest rates could start coming down as early as March. While this is still purely speculation, the Fed’s favorite inflation metric the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index numbers came in at [3.2% beating expectations of 3.3%](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/pce-inflation-november-2023-.html) and signaling we may see a soft landing yet.

Couple this with the yearly Santa Rally after a long year of dismal returns and a new generation of retail options trader, it’s possible we may have the perfect ingredients for a real Christmas miracle!
