After fidgeting around for too long trying to implement a Rust based micro-service to handle CRUD operations on the Postgres backend which would interact with my Astro based website via HTMX, I came to the conclusion that I *actually wanted* a wesbite and decided to stick with Typescript. Although, I do still dream of having that blazingly fast, scalable, micro-serviced, enterprise solution for my blog that will most likely contain less text than the number of buzz words I could boast about on Twitter. For this very reason, I am writing this post in tandum with my progress as both a journal and a readme.

First things first, I briefly checked on what Postgres solution for Typescript already existed, but then quickly realized that it was 2023 and I could probably just daisy chain random words from a dictionary appended with `.js` to just get something accomplished. This lead me to a [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) video from [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) which had me sold in **100 seconds**, damn that guy is good. I'll leave the video below for anyone interested.

I already had a Postgres instance running on my "production" server and was quickly able to connect and `DROP tables`, finally something I'm actually good at doing! Luckily, I think only one user will be affected, and this way I was able to switch to the mich more simple & concise `prisma.schema`

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String    @unique
  name      String?
  createdAt TimeStamp @default(now())
  updatedAt TimeStamp @updatedAt
}
```

Coming from an **iOS** & **react-native** background this incredibly simple, understandable and type-safe syntax was a huge bonus for me â€” reminiscent of a long forgotten love named *Parse...*

## User Authentication & SMTP

The next things on my todo list was to prove the naysayers wrong and roll [my own crypto](https://github.com/asleepace/csa) solution for user auth ([*call me SBF*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried)), but it was getting late and I wanted at least something done before I went back to playing video games. I had heard good things about **NextAuth.js** and that it worked well with **Prisma**, so I performed a quick & dirty Google search, blindly clicked the first relevent looking [link](https://dev.to/prisma/passwordless-authentication-with-next-js-prisma-and-next-auth-5g8g) and copypasta'd some random schema into my `prisma.schema` file and voila! Next I added "full-stack developer" to my LinkedIn profile and then proceeded to go -13k/d in ranked Halo.
