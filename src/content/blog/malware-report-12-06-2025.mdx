**Digital Ocean Abuse Email**:

```txt
Hi,

We are writing to let you know that your Droplet asleepace-droplet at 192.241.216.26 was identified contributing 295.4 Mbps out of total 109.2 Gbps Distributed Denial of Service attack from 327 droplet(s) on our network aimed at 42.193.120.89.

Details of the Attack:-
Source IP:- 192.241.216.26
Total traffic used in attack:- 109.2 Gbps
asleepace-droplet contribution in attack:- 295.4 Mbps
Target of attack:- 42.193.120.89
Total Number of Droplets involved:- 327

The network traffic from your Droplet matches a pattern of malicious traffic originating from other Droplets targeted at a specific victim. If this traffic wasn’t intentional, it’s very likely your droplet has been compromised and is being used in Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Future reports for additional DDoS activity may require us to temporarily disconnect your droplet from the network to prevent additional abuse.


Your path to resolution will be influenced by how you use asleepace-droplet, your technical expertise, and/or your time available for investigation.

Path 1 - If asleepace-droplet does not collect or contain any data you need to preserve, we suggest destroying this Droplet and starting over. This is the most straightforward way to get back up and running. Please note, you will still be billed for your Droplet usage, even in a network disconnected state.

Path 2 - If asleepace-droplet stores data you need to recover, please follow our recovery checklist on https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/resources/recovery-iso/ before destroying this Droplet and starting over. This is the best path if you do not wish to attempt recovery of your Droplet, but do need to recover data from it before destroying it.

Path 3 - If you are confident in your technical ability and want to troubleshoot, identify, and triage the problem on your own, we do have a resource available at https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/resources/ddos/ that includes some suggestions.

We would also like to make sure you're aware of a few things before you begin taking any of the above steps, as they may help guide you to the correct choice in this issue.

First, as this indicates a high probability that your Droplet has been compromised, please be aware that merely changing passwords or adding a firewall rule or any other form of access control won’t resolve this issue, as your Droplet has already been compromised. A malicious attacker has installed software on your Droplet, which was then used to launch this attack.

Finally, as a self-managed provider, we cannot access customer Droplets at the command line or application level. This means we can only provide you guidance from the information you give us about your Droplet server in regards to error logs, configuration files, or the output of commands.

If you believe this is a false positive, get stuck, or have a question please do not hesitate to reply to this email to get more support!

Best,
Security Operations Center
DigitalOcean

---

## Attack Analysis

### Entry Point
The attackers exploited the React RCE vulnerability in my Next.js application to gain initial code execution. No authentication was required.

### Malware Deployed

I discovered **five distinct malware families** on the compromised server:

#### 1. **Credential Harvesting Script**
A comprehensive scanner targeting:
- `.env` files (50+ filename variations)
- Crypto wallet files and private keys
- API keys (GitHub, Stripe, OpenAI, etc.)
- Database credentials
- Session tokens

**Evidence of exfiltration:**
```json
{"destination":"_root_smart-contracts_frontend_.env.local","success":true}
```

#### 2. **MeshAgent RAT (Remote Access Trojan)**
- **Purpose:** Persistent remote access
- **Persistence:** systemd service + cron job
- **Stealth:** Process hiding via `/proc` bind mounts
- **Detection evasion:** Hidden from `ps`, `top`, `htop`

**Cron job (ran every minute):**
```bash
pgrep -f meshagent | while read pid; do 
    mount -o bind /tmp/empty /proc/$pid 2>/dev/null
done
```

#### 3. **DDoS Botnet Client**
- **Binary name:** `fghgf` (obfuscated)
- **Attack contribution:** 295.4 Mbps (part of 109.2 Gbps attack)
- **Total infected servers:** 327 DigitalOcean droplets
- **Target:** IP address in China

#### 4. **Anti-Competitive Script**

A script that killed competing malware (especially crypto miners) to preserve resources:

```bash
while true; do
    # Kill XMRig and other miners
    pgrep xmrig && pkill -9 xmrig
    sleep 45
done
```

#### 5. **XMRig Monero Miner (Attempted)**
- **Status:** Dropper found but not executed (caught in time)
- **Target:** Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency mining
- **Pool:** pool.hashvault.pro:443
- **Disguise:** Masqueraded as "system-update-service" systemd unit

---

## Detection Indicators

### How I Discovered the Compromise

1. **DigitalOcean Abuse Email** - DDoS participation notification
2. **Suspicious Processes:**

```
   meshagent
   fghgf
   ci87vl87hn87lju2
   [kswapd0]  (fake kernel process)
```
3. **Unusual Cron Jobs:**

```bash
   crontab -l  # Revealed meshagent hiding script
```
4. **Suspicious Files:**

```
   /tmp/find.sh (36KB credential scanner)
   /dev/x86 (UPX-packed malware)
   /dev/health.sh (miner killer)
```

### Key Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

**Files to check:**

```bash
/tmp/fghgf
/tmp/meshagent*
/tmp/find.sh
/tmp/.del
/dev/x86
/dev/health.sh
/usr/local/mesh_services/
```

**Processes:**

```bash
ps aux | grep -E "meshagent|fghgf|ci87"
```

**Network connections:**

```bash
netstat -tupn | grep ESTABLISHED
# Look for unknown IPs, especially mining pools
```

**Crontabs:**

```bash
crontab -l
sudo cat /etc/crontab
sudo ls /var/spool/cron/crontabs/
```

**Systemd services:**

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service | grep -v "systemd\|ssh\|nginx"
# Look for suspicious service names like "system-update-service"
```

---

## Remediation Steps

### Immediate Actions Taken

1. **Killed Malicious Processes:**
```bash
   sudo pkill -9 meshagent
   sudo pkill -9 fghgf
   sudo pkill -9 xmrig
```

2. **Removed Malware:**
```bash
   sudo rm -rf /tmp/meshagent* /tmp/fghgf /tmp/find.sh
   sudo rm -rf /dev/x86 /dev/health.sh
   sudo rm -rf /usr/local/mesh_services/
```

3. **Removed Persistence:**
```bash
   crontab -r
   sudo systemctl disable meshagent
   sudo rm /usr/lib/systemd/system/meshagent.service
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. **Patched Vulnerability:**
```bash
   npm install next@15.0.5 react@latest react-dom@latest
   npm run build
   # Restart application
```

5. **Rotated Compromised Credentials:**
   - Database passwords
   - API keys
   - OAuth secrets
   - Session tokens

### Security Hardening
```bash
# Install fail2ban
sudo apt install fail2ban -y

# Configure firewall
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw enable

# Restrict database to localhost
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/*/main/postgresql.conf
# Set: listen_addresses = 'localhost'
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Patch Immediately for Critical CVEs**
The attack occurred **24 hours after disclosure**. For CVSS 10.0 vulnerabilities:
- Subscribe to security advisories
- Patch within hours, not days
- Consider automated dependency updates (Dependabot)

### 2. **Defense in Depth**
A single vulnerability led to complete compromise. Implement:
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Host-based firewall
- File integrity monitoring

### 3. **Monitoring is Critical**
The compromise went undetected for 2+ days. Implement:
- Log aggregation and alerting
- Process monitoring
- Network traffic analysis
- File integrity checks (AIDE, Tripwire)

### 4. **Assume Breach**
Once discovered:
- Rotate ALL credentials immediately
- Review all access logs
- Consider full system rebuild
- Don't trust "cleanup" - malware may have backdoors

## Recommendations for Next.js Users

### Immediate Actions

1. **Check Your Version:**
```bash
   cat package.json | grep '"next"'
```

2. **If Vulnerable (Next.js < 15.0.5), Update NOW:**
```bash
   npm install next@15.0.5 react@latest react-dom@latest
   npm run build
   # Restart your application
```

3. **Scan for Compromise:**
```bash
   # Check for suspicious processes
   ps aux | grep -E "meshagent|xmrig|fghgf"
   
   # Check cron jobs
   crontab -l
   
   # Check for malware files
   sudo find /tmp /dev -type f -executable -mtime -7
```

### Long-term Security

- Enable automated security updates
- Implement log monitoring (ELK stack, Datadog, etc.)
- Use a process manager with monitoring (PM2, systemd)
- Regular security audits
- Principle of least privilege (don't run apps as root)
