The Lowest Common Ancestor or Least Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm is a classic computer science problem, and one that I've had somewhat of a storied personal experience with over my years as a software engineer. Whether you are new to computer science, brushing up for an interview or just a curious individual, I hope you will enjoy this article.
