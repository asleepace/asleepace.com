			<h1>Howdy, Friend ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my personal website, here you can find a wide array of random and unique content
        from unhinged internet ramblings to in-depth technical blog posts! If it's about Asleepace,
        then you're sure to find it here!

				Who is Asleepace?
      </b>
			<p>
        Well for starters my name is Colin Teahan, but my friends call me Ballin and when I
        was a young boy of about 13 years of age I created my first Xbox Live account which I tried 
        naming "Ace", unfortunately that was taken and instead I was bestown the name "Asleepace" by
        the internet Gods! (aka some random name generator). At least it's always available. ðŸ˜…

      <b>
				What can I find on this website?
      </b>
      <p>
        Pretty much everything & anything. I've been meaning to make a personal blog for quite some time
        now, but I've always dreamed of something greater. Instead you can think of this place as my personal
        playground, a place to expirament new technologies, deploy cool tools, test my code, and also a blog.
        Below is a list which more accurately describes what you may find in the depths...
      </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Unhinged internet ramblings</li>
				<li>Half-baked and un-safe development tools</li>
				<li>Narcissistic vanity multi-media</li>
				<li>The worst financial advice</li>
				<li>Random memes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Have fun, and enter at your own risk!
