+14153425232|If it’s only 108 folks in LA that were deported the protests were pretty out of hand. I’m not defending anyone who doesn’t view military occupancy on US soil as a non-issue. 

Those are cool stats, looks like other regions are housing a large number of undocumented immigrants other than CA. I can’t tell if these reflect an actual reduction in total or just a reduction in undocumented immigrants in CA, it’s possible the numbers were higher across the board. 

Is he deporting illegals with jobs? I swear I saw something about ICE helicopters picking Mexicans straight off the farm 🥺🤦🏻‍♂️|2025-06-13 23:56:13

+14155724844|Analysis: Colin Teahan stands out as the participant most focused on Trump. He brings up Trump’s name multiple times across different contexts—emergency powers, military use, and international relations—indicating a recurring interest or concern about Trump’s actions or influence. The other participants, while engaged in related political topics, do not mention Trump as frequently or with the same directness.
