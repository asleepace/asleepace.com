Those are cool stats, looks like other regions are housing a large number of undocumented immigrants other than CA. I can’t tell if these reflect an actual reduction in total or just a reduction in undocumented immigrants in CA, it’s possible the numbers were higher across the board.

chat449416128167948589|+14156861387|Do I think it’s a coincidence there were ice raids last weekend so people protested and overthrew police so the national guard had to be deployed the week before the army’s 250th|2025-06-14 09:02:32

chat449416128167948589|+14155724844|Analysis: Colin Teahan stands out as the participant most focused on Trump. He brings up Trump’s name multiple times across different contexts—emergency powers, military use, and international relations—indicating a recurring interest or concern about Trump’s actions or influence. The other participants, while engaged in related political topics, do not mention Trump as frequently or with the same directness.
Answer: Based on the conversation, Colin Teahan appears to be the most obsessed with Trump.|2025-06-14 09:24:44
